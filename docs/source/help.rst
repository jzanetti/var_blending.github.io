New Zealand Meteorological Service: https://www.metservice.com/national/home

MetService is New Zealand's national weather authority, providing comprehensive
weather information services, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to help protect
the safety and well-being of New Zealanders and the NZ economy

Back in 1992, New Zealand added to its list of world-firsts by creating a
commercial company out of its national weather service.
The idea was to enable its smart scientists to commercialise
their expertise – making money that would help support its
operations and reduce the cost of weather services to the tax
payer, while also delivering export earnings for New Zealand.

25 years on, that weather service is a world leader in public
 weather forecasting and commercial weather innovation. From our
 operations at home and in Australia, Asia and Europe, New Zealand’s
 own MetService has delivered over $50m in dividends and $30m
 in tax to the nation. Over the same period, we've introduced
 many new public weather services and maintained an enviable
  record of accuracy in our forecasts for New Zealanders.

Our record of sustained innovation and forecasting quality has
earned MetService the respect of the international weather community.
With a reputation for doing exciting things that make an impact in
the market, MetService is regarded as a benchmark for success. 
Being government-owned adds to this respect, and our contribution
is sought internationally to help solve the weather challenges of the future.
